## Comments

#### Things Done Well
You guys have a good start for your project.

#### Things That Can Be Improved
You use the project board and commits well, but I'd like to see some feature branches for the project as it makes the project more organized and demonstrates your understanding of git.

#### Other Comments
Your project scope is relatively small so I think you guys will get decently into your stretch goals.  Please keep the project board up to date so I can keep up to date with your project.  Thankyou and keep up the good work :)
