Our app will be an assignment/deadline aggregator that helps students stay on top of their deadlines during online learning. 
Also, it will help teachers maintain student engagement through remote learning. Our deadline aggregator will be in the form of a monthly view calendar that has indicators for any upcoming deadlines and assignments. 
The indicators will also have distinguishing features so that the client will know which class it is for. This way, the client won't need to remember to manually input their assignments and deadlines from the syllabus and from various sources of announcements.
If instructors fully commit to using our app as their primary outlet to students, our app will be successful.
