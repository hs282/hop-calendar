## retrospective for iteration 2

In iteration 2, we set up our endpoints and implemented 
more methods in our classes. We also set up a calendar and all the front end
views. We will work on creating student, instructor, and course objects and passing information between the view files so that each page displays information
according to the logged-in instructor/student.
