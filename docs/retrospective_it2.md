## retrospective for iteration 2

(The retrospective is an opportunity for your team 
to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted 
during the next iteration. Review what you had done in iteration 2; 
note things that you have and have not delivered, note the challenges 
you had, and reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to 
do a better job.) 

In iteration 2, we set up our endpoints and implemented 
more methods in our classes. We also set up a calendar and all the front end
views.
