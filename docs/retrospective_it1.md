In iteration 1, we finalized the classes that our app would require. We created classes for Student,
Instructor, Course, and Task, and implemented their respective functions. All four teammates downloaded and configured necessary library/tools and unified our development set-up. We also decided who would work on the front- and/or back-end development. Further tweaks and optimization will be made to the classes we have for now as we add nice-to-have features after implemented most, if not all, of the must-have ones. We plan to focus on the must-have features for now. We've experienced minor issues while using github; now we know more.
