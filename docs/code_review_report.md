We believe our program is well-designed and demonstrates a number of Design Principles studied in class. Our program follows the Single Responsibility Principle well because the group has spent consistent effort on Class UML diagrams for each iteration. Our classes are well abstracted and clearly reflect real world use patterns. Also, our program demonstrates the Dependency Inversion Principle very well. For example, a change we made to our program was to have Course (has a collection of Tasks) store Task ID’s instead of an array of Task Objects. Therefore a higher level class such as Course won’t be changed due to the modification of the Task class. In addition, this change allows our program to be Open for extension but Closed to modification. 

Some parts of our code may be complex but we believe that we have reduced it to its simplest reasonable form. In past iterations we have had repeated code snippets that we have since outsourced into small functions for improved readability. We follow consistent and conventional naming techniques for variables, functions, and classes and believe other developers would easily be able to understand our program. 

Before this iteration, the accumulation of comments in our codebase was starting to become a problem. We had a lot of previous implementations as well as print statements commented out instead of productive comments that would help a new developer. While these random comments would help the team in development, a lot of them were outdated and began taking away from the readability. We cleaned up the comments significantly in this iteration and have begun the process of adding new instructional documentation that will help any new developers understand our code well. 

We have included documentation in the form of a README in order to help new developers run our code locally and as well as visit the deployed version. We have also included a brief tutorial for local database and package manager installation to help expedite the process. Tim was responsible for updating the README because he was the most familiar with Node.js environment. Hyunsu was responsible for cleaning up deprecated comments and print statements as well as adding new informative comments and simplifying/refactoring the code for the frontend. Jangwoo and Inpyo ensured that our project adhered to the design principles as well as code best practices. This included updating the UML class diagram, refactoring functions, as well as making major decisions on structuring the schema.
