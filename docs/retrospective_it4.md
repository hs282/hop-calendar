In Iteration 4, we worked on getting the front end to successfully communicate with the backend. We completed all of our must-have features, along with two nice-to-haves. We had planned to implement one more nice-to-have during Iteration 4, which was enabling students to mark tasks as complete/incomplete, but this feature is not yet functioning as expected. We struggled a lot with deploying the app on Heroku, but with the help of online resources and much discussion among Jang Woo, Inpyo, and Tim, we were able to get the deployment to work successfully. Since the UI of our app still looks primitive, we will continue polishing it during Iteration 5. We will also focus on connecting our app to SIS to load course data.
