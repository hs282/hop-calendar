Retrospective for iteration 5 (final)

We have delivered all must-have requirements and most of the nice-to-have features we originally planned at the beginning of this project. Among the nice-to-have features we listed in our original SRS, we ended up dropping adding priority features to each task and building a Q&A board. Although we had aimed to have our app pull information related to assignments, exams, etc. from all websites used by JHU professors by using a text scraper we built, we were ultimately not able to scrape from all potential platforms. However, we were able to deliver all of our must-have features and most of our nice-to-haves (for reference, please see SRS - delivered features have been marked as completed). As for now, the text scraper is functional but inconsistent on our Heroku (cloud) server.
